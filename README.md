# Smart-Traffic-Light-System-ATmega164P-
Designed a Finite State Machine (FSM) for an adaptive traffic light control system with emergency vehicle prioritization. Implemented Timer0 interrupt-driven state transitions and combinational logic (CLC/CLS) in Embedded C. Developed, tested, and debugged the firmware using CodeVisionAVR and AVR Studio.
